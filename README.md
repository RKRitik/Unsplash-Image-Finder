# Demo app



Build a demo project, in which you will use React, redux and saga.
Create a an e-commerce page, where you will fetch a list of images, and  a search input, where when you type the image name, you get the desired results.
Create a like button, on the image, where a user can like and unlike an image.

Use https://unsplash.com/developers for the api's.

In that, create a user profile, which shows, the liked images that we have selected. Store those images in the reducer and then, show those, in the profile page.
Things to take care of: 
Routes
ReactJS and Redux project setup
Saga flow, for api calls
Project architecture.
